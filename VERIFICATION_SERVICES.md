## üîÑ Verification Workflow

### 1. User Initiates Verification
- User clicks verification option in dropdown menu
- System checks authentication status
- Appropriate verification service is called

### 2. External Service Processing
- User is redirected to external service (ID verification)
- Or prompted for information (address verification)
- External service processes verification

### 3. Callback Handling
- External services send webhooks to our endpoints
- System updates user verification status
- User receives notification of verification result

### 4. Status Tracking
- Verification status stored in user profile
- Real-time status updates via API
- Integration with payout threshold system

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All verification data encrypted in transit
- Sensitive information not stored locally
- Compliance with GDPR and CCPA regulations
- PCI DSS compliance for financial data

### Authentication
- All verification endpoints require user authentication
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- Rate limiting on verification endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization

### Privacy
- Minimal data collection principle
- User consent for verification processes
- Data retention policies
- Right to data deletion
