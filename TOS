2. Description of Services

PacMac provides an online storefront for purchasing new devices, arranging trade‑ins through our partner Phobio, applying for lease‑to‑own financing through Progressive Leasing, initiating Apple‑authorized trade‑ins and repairs, and ordering wireless internet plans via Nomad Internet. When you engage with third‑party services through our website, those partners may have their own terms of service or policies; you are responsible for reviewing and agreeing to them. We are not responsible for the content or policies of those third‑party services

6. Payments

We accept various payment methods as displayed during checkout. By submitting payment information, you represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any payment method(s) utilized. For lease‑to‑own arrangements through Progressive Leasing, you will enter into a separate lease agreement with the provider and may be subject to additional terms and credit approvals.

7. Trade‑In Programs

If you trade in a device through our partner Phobio or Apple’s authorized trade‑in program, you agree to provide truthful information about the device’s model, condition, and ownership. Trade‑in values are estimates and may change after inspection. You acknowledge that your trade‑in device becomes the property of the trade‑in partner upon acceptance and that you relinquish any claims to the device or its contents once it is received.

8. Lease‑to‑Own Financing

Lease‑to‑own financing is offered by Progressive Leasing or other third‑party providers. PacMac does not make credit decisions; eligibility, payment schedules, and final purchase options are determined by the provider. By choosing this option, you consent to share necessary personal information with the financing provider for credit evaluation.

9. Nomad Internet Plans

Orders for home or travel internet plans are fulfilled by Nomad Internet. Coverage and service availability depend on your location. You agree to provide accurate information (e.g., ZIP code) for availability checks and to comply with Nomad’s terms and conditions. PacMac is not liable for service outages or performance issues related to third‑party network providers
