Heck yes, Matty ‚Äî let‚Äôs ship a sleek PacMac Mobile storefront üöÄ

I dropped a complete, *single-file* HTML/CSS/JS site into the canvas. It‚Äôs minimal, fast, and has a black, animated, mouse-reactive starfield background. The UI is Apple-clean. You‚Äôve got:

* Product grid + cart with localStorage
* Checkout modal (demo payment)
* Plugin-ready adapters for:

  * **Phobio** (trade-in quotes + submit)
  * **Apple Authorized Trade-In** (stubbed adapter + flow)
  * **Progressive Leasing** (pre-qual + from-cart start)
  * **Nomad Internet** (ZIP availability + order)

Everything runs with no libraries ‚Äî just open the file and go.

### How to run (step-by-step, super clear)

1. Save the canvas file as `index.html`.
2. Double-click to open in your browser. That‚Äôs it.
   If you prefer a local server: run `python -m http.server` in the folder, then open the shown URL.

### Where to plug in real APIs (exact lines to edit)

I built a tiny ‚Äúadapter‚Äù layer so you can swap demo logic for real endpoints without hunting.

* **Open** `index.html`
* **Find** the `CONFIG` object (search `const CONFIG = {`)

  * Replace placeholder endpoints/API keys for each provider.
* **Phobio**

  * Go to the **Phobio adapter** (search `// ---- Phobio Adapter ----`)
  * In `quote(model, condition)`, replace the mock with the real `fetch` (the exact request is already scaffolded inside the function as a comment).
  * Do the same in `submit(details)`.
* **Apple Authorized Trade-In**

  * Section `// ---- Apple Authorized Trade-In Adapter (placeholder) ----`
  * Swap `start(model)` and `quote(model)` mocks with your provider‚Äôs real calls.
* **Progressive Leasing**

  * Section `// ---- Progressive Leasing Adapter ----`
  * Replace `prequalify(...)` mock with your partner API call.
  * `startFromCart(items)` already wires cart ‚Üí prequal UI.
* **Nomad Internet**

  * Section `// ---- Nomad Internet Adapter ----`
  * Replace `availability(zip)` and `order(planId, customer)` with the real endpoints.

> Tip: every adapter already returns clean JSON objects the UI expects. Keep the same return shape and everything on the page will ‚Äújust work.‚Äù

### What the starry background does

* Infinite parallax starfield drawn on a `<canvas>`
* Reacts to mouse position and scroll (twinkles lightly)
* Super lightweight, no libraries

### File structure (literal ‚Äúput it here‚Äù)

* You only need **one** file: `index.html`
* Later, if you want to split:

  * `assets/js/starfield.js` ‚Üí move the star canvas code
  * `assets/js/storefront.js` ‚Üí products/cart/flows
  * `assets/js/plugins.js` ‚Üí adapters (Phobio, Apple Trade-In, Progressive, Nomad)
  * `assets/css/theme.css` ‚Üí styles
  * Then add `<link>` and `<script>` tags in `index.html` bottom/top accordingly.

### How to add new services (copy-paste recipe)

1. In `index.html`, search `window.PMMPlugins = { ... }`
2. Add your new adapter, e.g.:

   ```js
   const NewService = {
     async doThing(input){ /* call real API here */ return { ok:true } }
   };
   window.PMMPlugins.NewService = NewService;
   ```
3. Hook up a button in the HTML and call `PMMPlugins.NewService.doThing(...)`. The flow modal helper (`openFlow`) makes it easy to present results.

Want me to wire real endpoints next? If you share the API docs for Phobio, Progressive Leasing, Apple‚Äôs authorized trade-in partner, or Nomad, I‚Äôll map exact payloads, headers, and error states right into those adapter functions so you can paste in keys and go live.
